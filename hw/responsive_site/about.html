    <h1> About </h1>
    <p>Songstress, Alecsys, has been fighting asthma all of her life but you wouldn't know it to hear her sing.  Her voice is angelic and she believes that her music can heal the world.  "Being in a hospital is no fun" she says, "and no child should go to bed at night scared or feeling alone". With that thought in mind, she created Brown Eyed Lullabies, a foundation designed to encourage health through song, dance and other artistic pieces for sick and hurt youth in children's hospitals all over the United States.

    Brown Eyed Lullabies is a musical foundation designed to provide a digital hand to hold at night and encourage the healing of young minds, bodies and spirits..
